# OpenTelemetry Collector: Connectors

## Overview

**Connectors** are a first-class OpenTelemetry Collector component type that act as **both an exporter and a receiver**. A connector bridges two pipelines: it receives data as an exporter on one pipeline and emits data as a receiver on another. This enables cross-pipeline signal routing, aggregation, and transformation patterns that are impossible with standard pipeline stages.

## What Are Connectors?

A connector simultaneously acts as:

- **Exporter** (consuming data from a source pipeline)
- **Receiver** (emitting data into a destination pipeline)

```
Pipeline A (Traces) → [connector as exporter] → [connector as receiver] → Pipeline B (Metrics)
```

### Why Connectors?

Without connectors, generating metrics from traces requires external tools (e.g., span-to-metrics exporters, separate agents). Connectors enable this natively inside the collector, reducing latency, operational complexity, and cost.

### Service Pipeline Definition

Connectors are declared in the `service.pipelines` section by listing the same connector as both an exporter in the source pipeline and a receiver in the destination pipeline:

```yaml
service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [memory_limiter, batch]
      exporters: [span_metrics]          # connector as exporter

    metrics:
      receivers: [span_metrics]          # same connector as receiver
      processors: [memory_limiter, batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

---

## Production-Relevant Connectors

Configuration examples use the canonical component IDs `span_metrics`, `service_graph`, and `signal_to_metrics`. Collector Contrib still accepts the older compact IDs as deprecated aliases. Package/component names such as `spanmetricsconnector` and `signaltometricsconnector` are unchanged.

| Connector | Purpose | Source Signal | Output Signal | Stability |
|-----------|---------|---------------|---------------|-----------|
| `spanmetricsconnector` | R.E.D. metrics from traces | Traces | Metrics | Beta |
| `servicegraphconnector` | Service dependency graph | Traces | Metrics | Beta |
| `routingconnector` | Attribute-based pipeline routing | Any | Same signal | Alpha |
| `failoverconnector` | Automatic pipeline failover | Any | Same signal | Alpha |
| `countconnector` | Count signals as metrics | Any | Metrics | Alpha |
| `signaltometricsconnector` | Convert any signal to metrics | Any | Metrics | Alpha |

## spanmetricsconnector: R.E.D. Metrics from Traces

Generates **R.E.D. metrics** (Rate, Errors, Duration) from trace spans without requiring a separate agent or post-processing step.

### Generated Metrics

- `traces.span.metrics.calls` (counter): Request rate and error rate
- `traces.span.metrics.duration` (histogram): Latency distribution

### Configuration

```yaml
connectors:
  span_metrics:
    histogram:
      explicit:
        buckets: [5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000]  # milliseconds
    dimensions:
      - name: http.request.method
        default: GET
      - name: http.response.status_code
      - name: service.name
    exemplars:
      enabled: true              # Link metrics to traces via exemplars
    metrics_flush_interval: 60s  # How often to flush aggregated metrics

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [memory_limiter, batch]
      exporters: [otlp, span_metrics]    # forward traces AND generate metrics

    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp, span_metrics]    # receive both OTLP metrics and generated metrics
      processors: [memory_limiter, batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

### ⚠️ Stickiness Requirement

`spanmetricsconnector` is **stateful** — it aggregates metrics in-memory across spans. In a multi-replica gateway deployment, all spans for the same service or trace must route to the **same collector instance**.

```yaml
# Agent-tier: use load_balancing exporter to stick spans to a gateway replica
exporters:
  load_balancing:
    routing_key: traceID              # deterministic routing to gateway
    protocol:
      otlp:
        tls:
          insecure: true
    resolver:
      k8s:
        service: otel-gateway-headless  # ⚠️ must be Headless Service
```

### Cardinality Warning

⚠️ **Avoid high-cardinality dimensions** in `spanmetricsconnector`. Adding `user.id`, `request.id`, or raw `url.path` as dimensions creates millions of time series. Apply the **Rule of 100**: only include dimensions with fewer than 100 unique values.

---

## servicegraphconnector: Dependency Graphs

Generates **service dependency graph metrics** showing request rates and error rates between pairs of services.

### Generated Metrics

- `traces.service.graph.request.total` (counter): Total calls between service pairs
- `traces.service.graph.request.failed.total` (counter): Failed calls between service pairs
- `traces.service.graph.request.duration` (histogram): Latency between service pairs
- `traces.service.graph.unpaired_spans_total` (counter): Spans without matching pairs (incomplete traces)

### Configuration

```yaml
connectors:
  service_graph:
    latency_histogram_buckets: [1, 2, 6, 10, 100, 250]  # milliseconds
    dimensions:
      - http.request.method
    store:
      ttl: 2s          # Time to wait for matching spans
      max_items: 10000  # Max in-flight span pairs

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [memory_limiter, batch]
      exporters: [otlp, service_graph]   # forward traces AND generate graph metrics

    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp, service_graph]
      processors: [memory_limiter, batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

### ⚠️ Stickiness Requirement

Like `spanmetricsconnector`, the `servicegraphconnector` is **stateful**. It must see both the client span and the server span for a given request to compute the edge. Use the `load_balancing` exporter with `routing_key: traceID` to route all spans of a trace to the same gateway replica.

---

## routingconnector: Attribute-Based Pipeline Routing

Routes signals to different pipelines based on attribute values, enabling per-tenant or per-environment routing.

### Configuration

```yaml
connectors:
  routing:
    default_pipelines: [traces/default]   # fallback if no rule matches
    error_mode: ignore
    table:
      - statement: route() where attributes["tenant.id"] == "us-east"
        pipelines: [traces/us_east]
      - statement: route() where attributes["env"] == "prod"
        pipelines: [traces/prod]

service:
  pipelines:
    traces/in:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [memory_limiter]
      exporters: [routing]              # connector as exporter

    traces/us_east:
      receivers: [routing]             # same connector as receiver
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp/us_east]

    traces/prod:
      receivers: [routing]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp/prod]

    traces/default:
      receivers: [routing]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp/default]
```

### Routing Key Best Practices

✅ Use low-cardinality, deterministic attributes (`tenant.id`, `env`, `cluster`)
❌ Do not route on high-cardinality attributes (`user.id`, `request.id`) — this creates excessive pipeline fan-out

## failoverconnector: Automatic Pipeline Failover

Provides automatic failover between pipelines based on health/error conditions. When the primary pipeline experiences errors, traffic shifts to the secondary pipeline.

### Configuration

```yaml
connectors:
  failover:
    priority_levels:
      - [traces/primary]    # try this pipeline first
      - [traces/secondary]  # fallback if primary fails
    retry_interval: 10m     # how long before retrying the primary
    retry_gap: 10s          # gap between individual retry attempts
    max_retries: 3          # attempts before moving to next priority level

service:
  pipelines:
    traces/in:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [memory_limiter]
      exporters: [failover]           # connector as exporter

    traces/primary:
      receivers: [failover]           # connector as receiver
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp/primary]

    traces/secondary:
      receivers: [failover]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp/secondary]     # backup backend (e.g., different region)
```

### Use Case: Cross-Region Failover

```
Primary pipeline → us-east-1 backend
              ↓ (on failure)
Secondary pipeline → eu-west-1 backup backend
```

## countconnector: Signal Counting

Counts telemetry signals (spans, metric data points, or log records) and emits the counts as metrics. Useful for SLI instrumentation and billing.

### Configuration

```yaml
connectors:
  count:
    spans:
      - name: trace.span.count
        description: Total spans processed
        conditions:
          - 'attributes["http.route"] != nil'  # only count HTTP spans
        attributes:
          - key: http.request.method
          - key: http.response.status_code
          - key: service.name
    logs:
      - name: log.record.count
        description: Total log records
        attributes:
          - key: severity_text

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [memory_limiter, batch]
      exporters: [otlp, count]              # connector as exporter

    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp, count]              # connector as receiver
      processors: [memory_limiter, batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

---

## signaltometricsconnector: Any Signal to Metrics

Converts any signal type (traces, logs, or metrics) into metrics using OTTL expressions. More flexible than `spanmetricsconnector` for custom metric generation.

### Configuration

```yaml
connectors:
  signal_to_metrics:
    spans:
      - name: http.server.request.duration
        description: HTTP server request duration from spans
        unit: ms
        histogram:
          value: Milliseconds(end_time - start_time)
          bucket_boundaries: [0, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000]
          attributes:
            - key: http.request.method
            - key: http.route
            - key: http.response.status_code
    logs:
      - name: log.body.size
        description: Size of log body
        unit: By
        gauge:
          value: Int(Len(body))
          attributes:
            - key: severity_text

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [memory_limiter, batch]
      exporters: [otlp, signal_to_metrics]    # connector as exporter

    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp, signal_to_metrics]    # connector as receiver
      processors: [memory_limiter, batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

### ⚠️ Generated Metrics in Scaled Collectors

Each collector replica is a separate metric producer. Current `signal_to_metrics` releases emit sums, histograms, and exponential histograms with **delta temporality** and automatically add the resource attribute `signal_to_metrics.service.instance.id`, using the Collector's instance identity. That built-in attribute protects the generated streams only when the exporter and backend preserve or map it into the stored metric identity.

Review the backend's stored series, not only the Collector config. If `signal_to_metrics.service.instance.id` is dropped during resource-to-label translation, multiple replicas can collapse into the same histogram label set; a downstream delta-to-cumulative conversion can then create competing cumulative streams, resets, spikes, or incorrect totals. Preserve or map the built-in attribute. For an older/custom connector or another log/span-to-metric path that emits no producer identity, add a unique identity that is stable for the replica's lifetime. Use `service.instance.id` only when the generated metric resource intentionally represents the Collector; otherwise use a scoped attribute such as `collector_instance`.

Apply any fallback identity only to the connector-generated metric stream. If its destination pipeline also carries application metrics, split the generated metrics into a dedicated pipeline before enrichment rather than adding pod labels to every metric.

Dashboards and alerts must aggregate the producer identity away, for example with `sum by (<business dimensions>) (...)`. Retain histogram-specific grouping such as `le` when querying classic histogram buckets. A histogram's `_count` already supplies the event count (and event rate after `rate()`), so do not add a separate counter solely for that purpose.

Prometheus scraping usually adds target identity such as the `instance` label on the scrape path. Direct OTLP/backend export does not guarantee that resource identity becomes part of the backend's stored series, so verify it explicitly when reviewing replica count, effective temporality, and query aggregation.

## Connector Pipeline Patterns

### Pattern 1: Full Observability Stack (Traces + Metrics + Graphs)

```yaml
connectors:
  span_metrics: {}
  service_graph: {}

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [memory_limiter, k8s_attributes, batch]
      exporters: [otlp, span_metrics, service_graph]

    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp, span_metrics, service_graph]
      processors: [memory_limiter, batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

### Pattern 2: Multi-Tenant Routing with Fallback

```yaml
connectors:
  routing:
    default_pipelines: [traces/default]
    table:
      - statement: route() where resource.attributes["tenant.id"] == "acme"
        pipelines: [traces/acme]

service:
  pipelines:
    traces/in:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [memory_limiter]
      exporters: [routing]

    traces/acme:
      receivers: [routing]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp/acme_backend]

    traces/default:
      receivers: [routing]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp/shared_backend]
```

## Summary

✅ Use **spanmetricsconnector** to generate R.E.D. metrics from traces without extra agents
✅ Use **servicegraphconnector** to build service dependency maps from trace data
✅ Use **routingconnector** for attribute-based multi-tenant or multi-environment pipeline routing
✅ Use **failoverconnector** for automatic cross-region or cross-backend failover
✅ Always pair **stateful connectors** (span_metrics, service_graph) with the `load_balancing` exporter and `routing_key: traceID`
✅ Check **stability levels** — only `spanmetricsconnector` and `servicegraphconnector` are Beta; others are Alpha
⚠️ Avoid **high-cardinality dimensions** in span_metrics/service_graph to prevent time series explosion

**Connectors are the bridge between pipeline stages — use them to turn trace data into metrics and to route signals across pipelines without external tooling.**
