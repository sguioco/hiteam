# OpenTelemetry Production Playbooks

## Overview

This reference is a **routing-friendly playbook index** for OpenTelemetry blog
content that is relevant to this skill. The goal is not to retell one company
story in detail. The goal is to help the skill map user questions to the most
relevant upstream operating patterns, then load the right deep-dive references
from this repository.

The 2025 [Developer Experience SIG survey](https://opentelemetry.io/blog/2025/devex-survey/)
explicitly called out the need for better production examples, debugging
guidance, and more concrete deployment guidance. This document turns that need
into a scalable maintenance model for future blog routing.

Use this document when a user asks for:

- a **real-world deployment pattern**
- a **production rollout model** for a platform team
- a **blog-derived example** instead of a purely theoretical recommendation
- a recent **opentelemetry.io article** that is relevant to a practical OTel
  task
- a **generic playbook** that should remain reusable as more blogs are added

## How to Use This Reference

These playbooks are not meant to be copied verbatim. They should be used to
answer questions like:

- "Which upstream blog should I route to for this production question?"
- "What real-world pattern covers self-service onboarding on Kubernetes?"
- "What blog is most relevant for Lambda, logs, sampling, or naming?"
- "Which reference docs should the skill load after matching a blog-derived
  pattern?"

For each routed playbook, load deeper reference material from this repository as
needed:

- [architecture.md](architecture.md) for deployment models, multi-cluster, and
  scaling
- [collector.md](collector.md) for collector pipeline structure and operational
  mechanics
- [connectors.md](connectors.md) for routing and cross-pipeline patterns
- [instrumentation.md](instrumentation.md) for SDKs, auto-instrumentation,
  naming, and signal semantics
- [monitoring.md](monitoring.md) for health, failure visibility, and alerting
- [platforms.md](platforms.md) for Kubernetes, FaaS, browser, and platform
  patterns
- [sampling.md](sampling.md) for head, tail, and probability-based sampling
- [security.md](security.md) for TLS, auth, and exposure boundaries

## Playbook Routing Format

As more OpenTelemetry.io blog posts are integrated, keep each playbook entry in
this shape:

1. **Source**: the blog post URL and title
2. **Routing signals**: the kinds of user questions or keywords that should load
   it
3. **Playbook theme**: the reusable operational or instrumentation pattern
4. **Why it matters**: what skill behavior or production decision it informs
5. **Load next**: which local references should be loaded after routing
6. **Caveats**: limitations, maturity notes, or operational trade-offs

This structure keeps the skill generic. It routes by user intent and technical
problem space, not by a specific company name.

### Routing notes for future maintenance

- Prefer adding new entries to this list rather than creating one-off narrative
  sections.
- Route by **technical intent** such as sampling, logs, serverless, ingress,
  naming, or self-service onboarding.
- Keep source links stable and place company-specific stories in
  [Reference Links](#reference-links) unless their patterns become broadly
  generic and reusable.

---

## Generic Playbook Patterns

These patterns are intentionally generic so the skill can scale as more blogs
are added.

### Route by problem, not by company

The skill should match on the user's technical goal—such as Lambda export,
secure collector ingress, or naming guidance—not on a company name from a blog
post.

### Prefer self-service with safety rails

Good playbooks let application teams opt in through narrow, well-defined
interfaces while the platform retains the right guardrails.

### Keep semantic context out of names

For spans, attributes, and metrics, prefer low-cardinality names and put varying
context in attributes or resource metadata.

### Treat external collector ingress as a security boundary

If telemetry crosses clusters, networks, or trust domains, route to patterns
that include explicit authentication, encryption, and ownership boundaries.

### Adapt the topology to the runtime

Ephemeral runtimes like Lambda need different collector and export patterns than
long-running Kubernetes workloads.

### Choose auto-instrumentation mechanisms deliberately

"Auto-instrumentation" is not a single implementation strategy. The right
mechanism depends on runtime behavior, deployment model, and operational
constraints.

### Prefer declarative and portable configuration where possible

As OTel setups grow, YAML-first or schema-driven configuration becomes easier to
review, reuse, and scale than scattered ad hoc flags.

### Always connect a playbook to deeper docs

A blog route should be the front door. The implementation details should still
come from the local references in this repository.

---

## Common Failure Modes

### ❌ Routing on company names instead of technical intent

This makes the skill brittle and limits reuse as more upstream blogs are added.

### ❌ Treating all auto-instrumentation as the same thing

Different runtimes use different mechanisms with different trade-offs.

### ❌ Putting dynamic context into span or metric names

That breaks aggregation, increases cardinality, and makes dashboards harder to
reuse.

### ❌ Exposing collectors without a clear trust model

External OTLP ingress should be treated as a security-sensitive boundary.

### ❌ Blocking ephemeral runtimes on exporter completion

Serverless systems need export paths that respect execution and billing limits.

### ❌ Letting configuration sprawl across ad hoc flags and one-off tweaks

As environments scale, declarative and shared configuration becomes more
maintainable.

### ❌ Answering advanced sampling questions with only basic head-vs-tail advice

Some user questions require consistent probability sampling and TraceState-aware
explanations.

## Summary

✅ Keep production playbooks **generic, reusable, and routing-friendly**
✅ Use an **expandable 2025-2026 blog routing scan** instead of centering the
document on one org
✅ Route by **technical problem space** such as serverless, ingress, logs,
metrics, naming, transforms, and sampling
✅ Treat blog posts as **entry points** and local references as the detailed
implementation guides
⚠️ Avoid coupling the skill to **company-specific narratives** when the same
pattern can be expressed generically
⚠️ Keep expanding this index as new upstream blog posts become relevant to the
skill
