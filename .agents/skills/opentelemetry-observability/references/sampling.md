## Why Sampling?

### The Cost Problem

**Production trace volume** at scale:
- 10,000 requests/second × 10 spans/request = 100,000 spans/second
- 100,000 spans/second × 60 seconds × 60 minutes × 24 hours = **8.64 billion spans/day**
- At $0.10 per million spans: **$864/day = $26,000/month**

**With 1% sampling**:
- 86.4 million spans/day
- $8.64/day = **$260/month** (99% cost reduction)

### The Trade-off

Sampling reduces cost but introduces **incomplete visibility**:
- ✅ Errors and slow requests: Keep 100%
- ✅ Rare endpoints: Keep 100%
- ⚠️ Normal requests: Keep 1-10%

**Goal**: Sample intelligently to minimize cost while maximizing signal.

## Head Sampling

**Head sampling** makes the sampling decision **at the start of the trace** (at the root span creation).

### How It Works

```
Request arrives → SDK generates trace_id → Hash(trace_id) % 100 < sampling_rate?
├─ YES → Trace is sampled (all spans are recorded)
└─ NO  → Trace is NOT sampled (no spans are recorded)
```

**Key Point**: The decision is made **before** any spans are created. If a trace is not sampled, **no spans are sent**.

### Advantages

✅ **Simple**: Easy to configure
✅ **Efficient**: No processing overhead (spans are never created)
✅ **Deterministic**: Same trace_id always produces the same decision
✅ **Distributed**: Works across microservices (via context propagation)

### Disadvantages

❌ **Blind to content**: Cannot sample based on span attributes (error status, latency)
❌ **Statistical**: May miss important traces (e.g., a rare error in an unsampled trace)

### Configuration: ParentBasedTraceIdRatio

**Always use `ParentBased`** to ensure downstream services respect upstream sampling decisions.

#### Python

```python
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.sampling import ParentBasedTraceIdRatio

# Sample 10% of traces
sampler = ParentBasedTraceIdRatio(0.1)

provider = TracerProvider(sampler=sampler)
```

#### Go

```go
import (
    sdktrace "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace"
)

sampler := sdktrace.ParentBased(sdktrace.TraceIDRatioBased(0.1))

provider := sdktrace.NewTracerProvider(
    sdktrace.WithSampler(sampler),
)
```

#### Java

```java
import io.opentelemetry.sdk.trace.samplers.Sampler;

Sampler sampler = Sampler.parentBasedBuilder(Sampler.traceIdRatioBased(0.1)).build();

SdkTracerProvider provider = SdkTracerProvider.builder()
    .setSampler(sampler)
    .build();
```

#### Environment Variable

```bash
export OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER=parentbased_traceidratio
export OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG=0.1  # 10%
```

### Why ParentBased?

**Without ParentBased**:
```
Service A (sampled)   → Span A recorded ✅
Service B (not sampled) → Span B NOT recorded ❌
```
**Result**: Incomplete trace (broken trace graph)

**With ParentBased**:
```
Service A (sampled)   → Span A recorded ✅
Service B (inherits sampling decision) → Span B recorded ✅
```
**Result**: Complete trace

### When to Use Head Sampling

✅ **Low-traffic systems** (<1,000 RPS): Simple and effective
✅ **Cost-constrained environments**: Immediate volume reduction at SDK
✅ **Distributed systems**: ParentBased ensures trace completeness across services

---

## Tail Sampling

**Tail sampling** makes the sampling decision **after** all spans in a trace are collected, allowing intelligent decisions based on span content.

### How It Works

```
All spans collected → Assemble complete trace → Apply policies → Keep or Drop?
├─ ERROR status? → Keep 100%
├─ Latency > 500ms? → Keep 100%
├─ Rare endpoint? → Keep 100%
└─ Normal request → Keep 1%
```

**Key Point**: The collector **buffers all spans** for a trace, waits for the trace to complete, then decides.

### Advantages

✅ **Intelligent**: Keeps all errors, slow requests, and rare endpoints
✅ **Cost-optimized**: Drops boring traffic while retaining signals
✅ **Flexible**: Policy-based (error, latency, rate limiting)

### Disadvantages

❌ **Complex**: Requires stateful collector (sticky sessions)
❌ **Resource-intensive**: Must buffer spans in memory (high memory usage)
❌ **Latency**: Adds buffering delay (configurable, typically 10-30 seconds)

### Policies

The `tail_sampling` processor supports multiple policies:

| Policy | Description | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| `always_sample` | Keep 100% | Debug mode |
| `status_code` | Keep if span status = ERROR | Error tracking |
| `latency` | Keep if duration > threshold | SLO monitoring |
| `rate_limiting` | Keep N spans/second | Traffic limiting |
| `string_attribute` | Keep if attribute matches regex | Feature flags, A/B tests |
| `probabilistic` | Keep X% | Cost reduction for normal traffic |
| `composite` | Combine multiple policies (OR logic) | Production systems |

### Configuration

⚠️ **Intentional client-side HTTP cancellations may not set span status to `ERROR`.** Per current semantic convention guidance, client spans for user-driven aborts can remain `UNSET`, so an error-only `status_code` policy will not retain them. If canceled requests matter operationally, pair `status_code` with latency or attribute-based policies.

```yaml
processors:
  tail_sampling:
    # Wait time before making decision
    decision_wait: 10s
    
    # Max spans in memory
    num_traces: 50000
    
    # Expected new traces per second
    expected_new_traces_per_sec: 1000
    
    policies:
      # Policy 1: Keep all errors
      - name: errors
        type: status_code
        status_code:
          status_codes: [ERROR]
      
      # Policy 2: Keep slow requests (>500ms)
      - name: slow_requests
        type: latency
        latency:
          threshold_ms: 500
      
      # Policy 3: Keep specific endpoints
      - name: checkout_endpoint
        type: string_attribute
        string_attribute:
          key: http.route
          values: ["/checkout", "/payment"]
          enabled_regex_matching: false
      
      # Policy 4: Sample 1% of normal traffic
      - name: probabilistic
        type: probabilistic
        probabilistic:
          sampling_percentage: 1

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [memory_limiter, tail_sampling, batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

### Memory Sizing

**Formula**:
```
Memory (GB) = (num_traces × avg_spans_per_trace × avg_span_size) / 1,000,000,000
```

**Example**:
- `num_traces`: 50,000
- `avg_spans_per_trace`: 10
- `avg_span_size`: 1 KB

```
Memory = (50,000 × 10 × 1,000) / 1,000,000,000 = 0.5 GB
```

**Best Practice**: Set `num_traces` to handle `decision_wait` seconds of traffic:
```
num_traces = requests_per_second × decision_wait × spans_per_request
```

Example: 1,000 RPS × 10s × 10 spans = 100,000 traces

---

## Sampling Math

### Sampling Rate Calculation

**Goal**: Reduce to N spans/day

**Formula**:
```
sampling_rate = target_spans_per_day / current_spans_per_day
```

**Example**:
- Current: 8.64 billion spans/day
- Target: 86.4 million spans/day (1% of current)

```
sampling_rate = 86.4M / 8.64B = 0.01 = 1%
```

### Estimating Sampled Volume

**Formula**:
```
sampled_spans = total_spans × sampling_rate
```

**Example**:
- Total: 100,000 spans/second
- Sampling rate: 5%

```
sampled_spans = 100,000 × 0.05 = 5,000 spans/second
```

### Trace Completeness Probability

With **head sampling**, the probability that a multi-service trace is complete:

**Formula**:
```
P(complete) = sampling_rate ^ num_services
```

**Example** (3 microservices, 10% sampling):
```
P(complete) = 0.1^3 = 0.001 = 0.1%
```

**Conclusion**: Only 0.1% of traces will have all 3 services' spans.

**Solution**: Use `ParentBased` sampling to ensure 100% completion:
```
P(complete) = sampling_rate^1 = 0.1 = 10%
```

Now 10% of traces are sampled, and **all sampled traces are complete**.

---

## Architecture Requirements

### The Stickiness Requirement

**Critical**: Tail sampling requires **all spans of a trace to arrive at the same collector instance**.

#### Without Stickiness (BROKEN)

```
Span A (trace_id: 123) → Collector Pod 1 (buffers Span A, waits for Span B)
Span B (trace_id: 123) → Collector Pod 2 (buffers Span B, waits for Span A)

Decision Time:
- Pod 1: Incomplete trace (missing Span B) → Drops or makes wrong decision
- Pod 2: Incomplete trace (missing Span A) → Drops or makes wrong decision
```

**Result**: Data loss or incorrect sampling

#### With Stickiness (CORRECT)

```
Span A (trace_id: 123) → Collector Pod 1
Span B (trace_id: 123) → Collector Pod 1

Decision Time:
- Pod 1: Complete trace (has Span A + Span B) → Correct decision
```

### Solution: Load Balancing Exporter

Use a **two-tier architecture**:

```
Agent (with load_balancing exporter) → Gateway (with tail_sampling processor)
```

**Agent Configuration**:

```yaml
exporters:
  load_balancing:
    protocol:
      otlp:
        endpoint: placeholder
        tls:
          insecure: true
    routing_key: "traceID"  # Critical: ensures stickiness
    resolver:
      k8s:
        service: otel-gateway-headless
        ports:
          - 4317

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [memory_limiter, batch]
      exporters: [load_balancing]
```

**Gateway Configuration**:

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317

processors:
  memory_limiter:
    limit_percentage: 80
    spike_limit_percentage: 20
  
  tail_sampling:
    decision_wait: 10s
    num_traces: 100000
    expected_new_traces_per_sec: 1000
    policies:
      - name: errors
        type: status_code
        status_code: {status_codes: [ERROR]}
      - name: slow
        type: latency
        latency: {threshold_ms: 500}
      - name: default
        type: probabilistic
        probabilistic: {sampling_percentage: 1}
  
  batch:
    timeout: 10s
    send_batch_size: 1024

exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: backend.example.com:4317

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [memory_limiter, tail_sampling, batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

**Headless Service**:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: otel-gateway-headless
spec:
  clusterIP: None  # Headless: returns pod IPs
  selector:
    app: otel-gateway
  ports:
  - name: otlp-grpc
    port: 4317
```

### Verification

Test stickiness with trace correlation:

```bash
# Generate traces with same trace_id from different agents
# All spans should end up on the same gateway pod

kubectl logs -l app=otel-gateway | grep "trace_id: 123abc"
```

All logs for `trace_id: 123abc` should come from the **same pod**.

## Configuration Examples

### Hybrid: Head + Tail Sampling

Combine both for optimal cost/signal:

1. **Head sampling at SDK**: Sample 10% at the application
2. **Tail sampling at gateway**: Keep 100% of errors/slow, 1% of normal

**Net effect**:
- Errors/slow: 10% sampled (SDK) × 100% kept (gateway) = **10% retained**
- Normal traffic: 10% sampled (SDK) × 1% kept (gateway) = **0.1% retained**

**Configuration**:

**SDK** (environment variables):
```bash
OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER=parentbased_traceidratio
OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG=0.1
```

**Gateway**:
```yaml
processors:
  tail_sampling:
    policies:
      - name: errors
        type: status_code
        status_code: {status_codes: [ERROR]}
      - name: slow
        type: latency
        latency: {threshold_ms: 500}
      - name: default
        type: probabilistic
        probabilistic: {sampling_percentage: 1}
```

### Rate-Limited Sampling

Limit to N spans/second per service:

```yaml
processors:
  tail_sampling:
    policies:
      - name: rate_limit
        type: rate_limiting
        rate_limiting:
          spans_per_second: 100
```

### Custom Attribute Sampling

Keep traces with specific feature flags:

```yaml
processors:
  tail_sampling:
    policies:
      - name: beta_features
        type: string_attribute
        string_attribute:
          key: feature_flag.key
          values: ["beta_checkout", "new_ui"]
          enabled_regex_matching: false
```

## Emerging Specifications

### Metric Links (Proposal)

The OpenTelemetry specification has an active proposal — [open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification#4854](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/issues/4854) — to introduce **metric links**: a concept analogous to span links, but for metrics.

**What it would enable**:
- Express relationships between a metric data point and other signals (spans, logs, or other metrics), similar to how span links connect related traces across contexts.
- Improve root-cause correlation when a metric anomaly is caused by a specific traced request or log event.

**Status**: 📋 Proposal / Discussion — not yet adopted into a stable OTel specification release. Do not implement against this feature in production until it reaches a stable spec.

**Track progress**: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/issues/4854
