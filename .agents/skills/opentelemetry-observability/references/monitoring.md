# OpenTelemetry Collector Meta-Monitoring

## Overview

"Who watches the watchers?" Meta-monitoring is the practice of observing the observability pipeline itself. A failing collector can silently drop data, creating blind spots in production systems. This reference provides comprehensive guidance on collector self-monitoring, health checks, and alerting patterns.

## Why Meta-Monitoring?

### The Silent Failure Problem

**Scenario**: Your collector is silently dropping 50% of traces due to memory pressure.

**Impact**:
- ❌ Missing spans in distributed traces
- ❌ Incorrect latency percentiles (p95, p99)
- ❌ Undetected errors
- ❌ False confidence in system health

**Solution**: Monitor the collector's internal metrics to detect issues **before** data loss becomes critical.

### What to Monitor

| Category | Metrics | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **Throughput** | Accepted vs sent spans/metrics/logs | Data flow verification |
| **Data Loss** | Refused, dropped, failed exports | Detect backpressure and failures |
| **Resources** | CPU, memory, disk usage | Prevent OOM kills |
| **Queue Health** | Queue size vs capacity | Predict saturation |
| **Export Performance** | Export latency, retry count | Backend health |

---

## Collector Telemetry

The collector exposes internal metrics on port **8888** (default).

### Enabling Telemetry

```yaml
service:
  telemetry:
    logs:
      level: info  # Options: debug, info, warn, error
    
    metrics:
      level: detailed  # Options: none, basic, normal, detailed
      address: "0.0.0.0:8888"  # Prometheus scrape endpoint
```

### Scraping Collector Metrics

**Prometheus scrape config**:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'otel-collector'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['otel-collector:8888']
    
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__address__]
        target_label: instance
```

**Kubernetes ServiceMonitor (with Prometheus Operator)**:

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  name: otel-collector
  namespace: observability
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: otel-collector
  endpoints:
  - port: metrics
    interval: 30s
    path: /metrics
```

## OTLP Self-Telemetry

The [OpenTelemetry Collector Internal Telemetry documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/internal-telemetry/) now recommends using **OTLP periodic readers** for self-observability instead of (or in addition to) the Prometheus scrape pattern. This enables the collector to push its own metrics directly to a backend without requiring an external scraper.

### Why OTLP for Self-Telemetry?

| Pattern | Pros | Cons |
|---------|------|------|
| **Prometheus scrape (pull)** | Simple, compatible with existing Prometheus stacks | Requires external scraper; pull model means delayed detection |
| **OTLP push (recommended)** | No external scraper; metrics arrive as fast as flush interval; unified with app telemetry in same backend | Requires OTLP-capable metrics backend |

### Configuration: OTLP Periodic Reader

Use `service.telemetry.metrics.readers` to configure an OTLP exporter for self-metrics:

```yaml
service:
  telemetry:
    logs:
      level: info
    metrics:
      level: detailed          # none | basic | normal | detailed
      readers:
        - pull:
            exporter:
              prometheus:
                host: "0.0.0.0"
                port: 8888     # keep Prometheus endpoint for existing dashboards

        - periodic:
            interval: 60000    # push interval in milliseconds (60s)
            timeout: 30000     # export timeout in milliseconds
            exporter:
              otlp:
                protocol: grpc
                endpoint: "http://otlp-backend:4317"
                headers:
                  authorization: "Bearer ${env:SELF_TELEMETRY_TOKEN:-}"
```

This configuration simultaneously:
1. Exposes metrics on `:8888` for existing Prometheus scrapers (backward compatible)
2. Pushes metrics every 60s via OTLP gRPC to a backend

### Self-Telemetry Pipeline Pattern

For environments where the same collector handles both application telemetry and self-telemetry, you can forward self-metrics through an OTLP loopback:

```yaml
service:
  telemetry:
    metrics:
      level: detailed
      readers:
        - periodic:
            interval: 30000
            exporter:
              otlp:
                protocol: grpc
                endpoint: "localhost:4317"   # loopback to own OTLP receiver

  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]                      # receives both app and self metrics
      processors: [memory_limiter, batch]
      exporters: [otlp/backend]
```

⚠️ **Loopback cardinality warning**: Self-metrics include collector-internal labels (receiver, processor, exporter names). These are low-cardinality and safe to forward, but ensure your backend can handle the additional time series.

### Resource Attributes for Self-Telemetry

Add resource attributes to self-telemetry for multi-collector environments:

```yaml
service:
  telemetry:
    resource:
      service.name: "otel-gateway"
      service.instance.id: "${env:POD_NAME}"
      k8s.namespace.name: "${env:NAMESPACE}"
      k8s.node.name: "${env:NODE_NAME}"
    metrics:
      level: detailed
      readers:
        - periodic:
            interval: 60000
            exporter:
              otlp:
                protocol: grpc
                endpoint: "http://central-backend:4317"
```

### When to Use OTLP vs Prometheus for Self-Telemetry

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|---------------|
| Existing Prometheus/Grafana stack | Keep pull (`:8888`) + optionally add OTLP push |
| Backend supports OTLP metrics natively | Use OTLP push exclusively (simpler ops) |
| Air-gapped or strict network policy environments | Use pull model (no outbound from collector required) |
| Multi-collector fleet with centralized backend | OTLP push with `service.instance.id` for per-collector attribution |

## Critical Metrics

### Metric Naming Convention

All collector metrics follow the pattern:
```
otelcol_{component}_{signal}_{metric}
```

**Examples**:
- `otelcol_receiver_accepted_spans`
- `otelcol_processor_dropped_metric_points`
- `otelcol_exporter_send_failed_log_records`

### Golden Signals for Collectors

#### 1. Throughput (Data Flow)

**Metrics**:
```promql
# Traces
otelcol_receiver_accepted_spans
otelcol_exporter_sent_spans

# Metrics
otelcol_receiver_accepted_metric_points
otelcol_exporter_sent_metric_points

# Logs
otelcol_receiver_accepted_log_records
otelcol_exporter_sent_log_records
```

**Query** (spans/second):
```promql
rate(otelcol_receiver_accepted_spans[1m])
rate(otelcol_exporter_sent_spans[1m])
```

**What to look for**:
- ✅ Accepted ≈ Sent → Healthy pipeline
- ⚠️ Accepted > Sent → Backpressure, queue filling
- ❌ Accepted >> Sent → Data loss

#### 2. Data Loss (Errors)

**Metrics**:
```promql
# Refused by receiver (backpressure)
otelcol_receiver_refused_spans

# Dropped by processor (filter/sampling)
otelcol_processor_dropped_spans

# Failed exports
otelcol_exporter_send_failed_spans
```

**Query** (dropped percentage):
```promql
100 * (
  rate(otelcol_processor_dropped_spans[1m]) +
  rate(otelcol_exporter_send_failed_spans[1m])
) / rate(otelcol_receiver_accepted_spans[1m])
```

**Alert threshold**: > 1% data loss

#### 3. Resource Usage

**Metrics**:
```promql
# Memory
otelcol_process_memory_rss  # Resident Set Size (actual RAM usage)

# CPU
rate(otelcol_process_cpu_seconds_total[1m])

# Goroutines (Go runtime)
otelcol_process_runtime_total_alloc_bytes
```

**Query** (memory usage percentage):
```promql
100 * otelcol_process_memory_rss / node_memory_MemTotal_bytes
```

**Alert threshold**: > 80% of container limit

#### 4. Queue Health

**Metrics**:
```promql
# Current queue size
otelcol_exporter_queue_size

# Max queue capacity
otelcol_exporter_queue_capacity
```

**Query** (queue saturation percentage):
```promql
100 * otelcol_exporter_queue_size / otelcol_exporter_queue_capacity
```

**Alert threshold**: > 80% full

#### 5. Export Performance

**Metrics**:
```promql
# Failed metric points sent to the backend
otelcol_exporter_send_failed_metric_points

# Spans rejected before enqueue
otelcol_exporter_enqueue_failed_spans
```

> **Sparse zero-value series in recent Collectors:** In Collector v0.156, exporter-helper failure counters may not be recorded until a failure occurs. Their absence can therefore mean "zero failures so far" rather than a broken scrape. Do not use `absent(otelcol_exporter_send_failed_*)` as a collector-liveness or data-loss alert. Pair failure-rate alerts with an independent scrape `up`, health-check, or heartbeat signal.

**Query** (export failure rate):
```promql
sum(rate(otelcol_exporter_send_failed_spans[5m]))
```

**Alert threshold**: > 0 (any failures)

---

## Health Checks

### Health Check Extension

The `health_check` extension provides HTTP endpoints for Kubernetes probes.

**Configuration**:

```yaml
extensions:
  health_check:
    endpoint: "0.0.0.0:13133"
    tls:
      ca_file: ""
      cert_file: ""
      key_file: ""
    path: "/"
    check_collector_pipeline:
      enabled: true
      interval: "5m"
      exporter_failure_threshold: 5

service:
  extensions: [health_check]
```

### Kubernetes Probes

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: otel-collector
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: otel-collector
        ports:
        - containerPort: 13133
          name: health
        
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /
            port: 13133
          initialDelaySeconds: 30
          periodSeconds: 10
          timeoutSeconds: 5
          failureThreshold: 3
        
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /
            port: 13133
          initialDelaySeconds: 10
          periodSeconds: 5
          timeoutSeconds: 3
          failureThreshold: 3
```

### Health Check Responses

**Healthy**:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "Server available",
  "uptime": "3h45m12s",
  "uptime_ns": 13512000000000
}
```

**Unhealthy** (exporter failing):
```
HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "Server unavailable",
  "error": "exporters: otlp: failed to send data: connection refused"
}
```

  group_wait: 10s
  group_interval: 10s
  repeat_interval: 12h
  
  routes:
    - match:
        component: otel-collector
        severity: critical
      receiver: pagerduty
      continue: true
    
    - match:
        component: otel-collector
        severity: warning
      receiver: slack

receivers:
  - name: pagerduty
    pagerduty_configs:
      - service_key: '<pagerduty_key>'
  
  - name: slack
    slack_configs:
      - api_url: '<slack_webhook>'
        channel: '#observability-alerts'
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Self-Observability Pipeline

Configure the collector to send its own telemetry to a backend:

```yaml
exporters:
  otlp/self:
    endpoint: backend.example.com:4317
    tls:
      insecure: false

service:
  telemetry:
    metrics:
      level: detailed
      address: "0.0.0.0:8888"
      
      # Export collector metrics via OTLP
      readers:
        - periodic:
            interval: 30s
            exporter:
              otlp:
                protocol: grpc
                endpoint: backend.example.com:4317
```

### Distributed Tracing of the Collector

Enable tracing for the collector itself:

```yaml
service:
  telemetry:
    traces:
      processors:
        - batch:
            timeout: 10s
      exporters:
        - otlp:
            endpoint: backend.example.com:4317
```

**Use case**: Debug collector performance issues by tracing its internal operations.

## Troubleshooting Checklist

### Collector Not Accepting Data

**Symptoms**: Upstream services fail to send data, HTTP 503 errors

**Check**:
```promql
rate(otelcol_receiver_refused_spans[1m])
```

**Causes**:
- Memory limiter triggered (check `otelcol_process_memory_rss`)
- Receiver port not exposed (check Kubernetes Service)
- Network policy blocking traffic

### Data Not Reaching Backend

**Symptoms**: Collector accepts data, but backend shows no traces

**Check**:
```promql
rate(otelcol_exporter_sent_spans[1m])
rate(otelcol_exporter_send_failed_spans[1m])
```

**Causes**:
- Exporter misconfigured (wrong endpoint, no TLS)
- Backend down (check export failures)
- Queue full (check `otelcol_exporter_queue_size`)

### High Memory Usage

**Symptoms**: Collector OOMKilled, restarts frequently

**Check**:
```promql
otelcol_process_memory_rss
otelcol_exporter_queue_size
```

**Causes**:
- No memory_limiter processor
- Queue too large (`queue_size` > memory allows)
- High throughput without batching

### Incomplete Traces (Tail Sampling)

**Symptoms**: Traces missing spans, incorrect sampling decisions

**Check**:
- Verify load_balancing exporter is using `routing_key: traceID`
- Check Headless Service is returning pod IPs, not VIP
- Verify `decision_wait` is long enough for trace completion

## Summary

✅ **Expose metrics** on port 8888 for Prometheus scraping
✅ **Or use OTLP push** via `service.telemetry.metrics.readers` for unified self-telemetry
✅ **Monitor throughput**: Accepted vs sent spans/metrics/logs
✅ **Alert on data loss**: `otelcol_exporter_send_failed_spans > 0`
✅ **Track memory usage**: Set alerts at 80% of limit
✅ **Watch queue saturation**: Alert when > 80% full — indicates downstream bottleneck
✅ **Use health checks**: Configure Kubernetes liveness/readiness probes
✅ **Deploy dashboards**: Use monitoringartist/opentelemetry-collector-monitoring
✅ **Self-observe**: Send collector metrics to the same backend with `service.instance.id`

**Meta-monitoring is not optional—it's the safety net that prevents silent data loss in production observability systems.**
