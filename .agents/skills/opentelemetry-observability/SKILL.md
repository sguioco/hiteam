# OpenTelemetry Skill

## Core Principles

Use these defaults:

1. **Stability over Features**: Check otelcol-contrib stability (Alpha/Beta/Stable) and warn on non-stable components in production.

2. **Convention over Configuration**: Prefer OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions over custom attribute names.

3. **Protocol Unification**: Default to **OTLP gRPC** (4317); use **OTLP HTTP** (4318) when gRPC is blocked by the agent, proxy, browser, or backend.

4. **Deterministic Routing Keys**: Use stable routing keys for load-balancing exporters (`traceID` for tail sampling, `tenant_id` or `cluster` for tenant/shard routing). Normalize non-string attributes first.

5. **Safety First**: Prefer collector stability (memory limiters, persistent queues, backpressure) over completeness. Dropping data is better than crashing the collector.

6. **Cardinality Awareness**: High-cardinality attributes (>100 unique values) must not be metric dimensions; use traces or logs instead.

7. **Security by Default**: Redact PII, enable TLS for cross-network communication, and authenticate all collector endpoints.

8. **Cross-Field Consistency**: Treat collector reviews as systems reviews. Check processor order, memory limits, replica strategy, routing, metric temporality, queue storage, PDB/HPA settings, and OTTL types together before calling a config safe.

## Pre-Flight Checklist

Before generating config/code, confirm these. If unknown, ask first:

1. **Signal volume** — High traffic (>10k RPS) or low volume? Drives sampling/scaling. → [sampling.md](references/sampling.md), [collector.md](references/collector.md)
2. **Cardinality risk** — Any unbounded metric attributes (user/request/session IDs)? Move to traces/logs. → [instrumentation.md](references/instrumentation.md)
3. **Resiliency** — Is restart/outage data loss acceptable? If no, use `file_storage` + persistent queues. → [collector.md](references/collector.md)
4. **Trust boundaries** — Any public-network hops? Require TLS + mTLS. → [security.md](references/security.md)
5. **Deployment target** — Kubernetes, EC2, Lambda, or containers? → [architecture.md](references/architecture.md)

## Eval-Critical Response Minimums

When user requests match these patterns, include these points explicitly:

- **Collector setup**: include `memory_limiter`; keep it first in each pipeline `processors` list; explain OOM-prevention rationale.
- **Metric dimension request for `user_id`**: refuse; explain time-series explosion risk; suggest traces and bounded metric dimensions.
- **Kubernetes tail sampling**: Gateway (Deployment) tier, `load_balancing` with `routing_key: traceID`, Headless Service (`clusterIP: None`), error+10% policies, Beta stability caution.
- **Claude Code telemetry**: include `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY=1`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_TEMPORALITY_PREFERENCE=cumulative`, and managed-settings persistence; traces are beta, while metrics and logs/events remain the broadly documented signals. Keep prompt/tool-content capture disabled unless PII controls are explicit, and avoid `session.id` as a metric dimension.
- **AI agent tool-call tracing**: for agents using current `gen_ai.*` conventions, set `gen_ai.operation.name: execute_tool`, preserve `gen_ai.tool.name`, and use the stable span name `execute_tool`; keep the actual tool name in the attribute.
- **GenAI provider vs agent identity**: preserve `gen_ai.provider.name` for the model/provider (for example, `openai` or `gcp.gen_ai`); use `service.name` or a natively emitted agent attribute for the coding-agent identity rather than writing the agent name into the provider field.

## Existing Configuration Review Mode

When the user provides an existing collector config, Helm values file, or Kubernetes manifest, audit it for internal contradictions before proposing edits.

Check these interactions together:

1. **Memory vs pod limit** — `limit_mib` must leave headroom for the Go runtime and buffers.
2. **Stateful processing vs scaling** — `tail_sampling`, `span_metrics`, and `service_graph` need sticky routing above one replica.
3. **Durability vs outage tolerance** — disabled retries and no persistent queue mean data loss on backend failure.
4. **Deployment mode vs exposure** — `hostPort` fits DaemonSet/node-local patterns, not scaled gateway Deployments.
5. **Rollout settings** — review `replicaCount`, HPA `minReplicas`, PodDisruptionBudget, and rolling updates together.
6. **OTTL/filter correctness** — keep attribute types consistent and prefer current semantic convention keys.
7. **Metric temporality and state** — `deltatocumulative` / `cumulativetodelta` need source/backend/restart checks.
8. **Queue storage backend** — `file_storage` needs local locking-safe storage; RWX, EFS, and NFS are unsafe defaults.
9. **Generated metric identity** — for log/span-to-metric connectors, verify replica count, export mode, actual temporality, whether the emitted producer identity survives backend mapping, and the aggregation query shape together.

## Progressive Disclosure: Context Triggers

Load detailed reference documentation only when the user's request matches a trigger. This keeps context lean.

## Production Baseline Configuration

Use this copy-paste-ready baseline unless the user wants something different:

```yaml
extensions:
  health_check:
    endpoint: "0.0.0.0:13133"
  file_storage/queue:
    directory: /var/lib/otelcol/queue
    timeout: 10s
    compaction:
      on_start: true
      on_rebound: false

receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: "0.0.0.0:4317"
      http:
        endpoint: "0.0.0.0:4318"

processors:
  memory_limiter:
    check_interval: 1s
    limit_percentage: 80
    spike_limit_percentage: 20
  batch:
    timeout: 10s
    send_batch_size: 1024

exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "your-backend:4317"
    sending_queue:
      enabled: true
      storage: file_storage/queue
      num_consumers: 4
      queue_size: 1024
    retry_on_failure:
      enabled: true
      initial_interval: 1s
      max_interval: 30s
      max_elapsed_time: 300s
  # otlphttp:                        # HTTP exporter — use when backend requires HTTP
  #   endpoint: "https://your-backend:4318"
  #   sending_queue: { enabled: true, storage: file_storage/queue }

service:
  extensions: [health_check, file_storage/queue]
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [memory_limiter, batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [memory_limiter, batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [memory_limiter, batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

Key defaults:

- `memory_limiter` must be first in every processor chain.
- `batch` reduces exporter network calls.
- `file_storage` preserves queues across restarts only on the same host/volume. In Kubernetes, back `/var/lib/otelcol/queue` with a `ReadWriteOnce` block-backed PVC, not RWX/network storage.
- `health_check` binds to `localhost` (not `0.0.0.0`) in shared networks.
- Prefer OTLP gRPC (port 4317) for receivers and exporters. Fall back to OTLP HTTP (port 4318) when gRPC is unavailable.

## Validation & Error Recovery

Always include at least one validation checkpoint: `otelcol validate --config <path>`.
For container dry-run commands, live pipeline checks, and symptom→cause→fix recovery, load [validation.md](references/validation.md).

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ Placing `memory_limiter` anywhere except first in the processor chain
❌ Using high-cardinality attributes (user_id, trace_id) as metric dimensions
❌ Exposing pprof (1777), zpages (55679) on `0.0.0.0` in production
❌ Using `tail_sampling` without sticky session load balancing (load_balancing exporter)
❌ Omitting `batch` processor (causes excessive network calls)
❌ Calling a config "fine" because it parses, without checking memory limits, sticky routing, exporter durability, and rollout settings together

See [anti-patterns.md](references/anti-patterns.md) for the full annotated catalog.

## Version and Compatibility

- Use [compatibility.md](references/compatibility.md) for fast-moving version floors and AI agent support details.
- Keep `SKILL.md` focused on routing logic, guardrails, and production defaults rather than inline release tracking.
