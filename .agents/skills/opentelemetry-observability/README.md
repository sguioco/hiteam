### What Makes This Different?

Unlike loading the entire OpenTelemetry documentation into an AI's context (which leads to hallucinations and information overload), this skill acts as a **cognitive router**:

1. **System 2 Thinking**: Forces the AI to analyze critical observability signals (throughput, cardinality, resiliency) before generating code
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Loads detailed reference materials only when specific topics are triggered
3. **Production-First**: Prioritizes stability, security, and cost optimization over feature completeness
4. **Convention Enforcement**: Ensures semantic conventions, proper processor ordering, and architectural best practices
5. **AI Agent Support**: Includes guidance for observing AI coding agents in production environments

## Core Features

- 🧠 **Cognitive Architecture**: Meta-knowledge layer that teaches AI *how* to think about observability
- 📊 **Cardinality Management**: Built-in guards against metric explosion and cost overruns
- 🏗️ **Deployment Patterns**: Platform-specific setup guides for Kubernetes, ECS, Docker, and standalone VMs
- 🎯 **Multi-Platform Support**: DaemonSet vs Gateway vs Sidecar decision matrices for Kubernetes; EC2 daemon and Fargate patterns for ECS; Docker Compose patterns
- 🔒 **Security by Default**: PII redaction, TLS/mTLS configuration, and authentication patterns with platform-specific guidance
- 🔄 **OTTL Transformations**: Comprehensive OpenTelemetry Transformation Language guidance with patterns and best practices
- 📈 **Scaling Strategies**: Load balancing with sticky sessions for tail sampling, resource management for high-throughput collectors
- 🎯 **Sampling Intelligence**: Head vs tail sampling with statistical trade-off analysis
- 🔍 **Meta-Monitoring**: Self-observability patterns for collector health
- 🤖 **AI Agent Observability**: Configuration guides for monitoring AI coding agents including Claude Code, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, Codex, Qwen Code, Pi Agent, and more via OpenTelemetry
- ✅ **Test & Validation Framework**: TDD-based testing methodology and 20+ comprehensive evaluation scenarios to ensure skill effectiveness

## Skill Structure

`SKILL.md` acts as the **cognitive router** — a compact instruction set that tells the AI how to reason about observability before generating any output. `docs/index.md` is the tile's on-demand documentation entrypoint for Tessl, and `references/` contains the deep-dive documents that the skill links to when specific topics are triggered.

The skill now includes **5 platform-specific setup guides** (`setup-kubernetes.md`, `setup-ecs.md`, `setup-docker.md`, `setup-vm.md`) that provide concrete deployment patterns and copy-paste-ready configurations for multiple cloud providers and deployment scenarios.

### 📊 **Content Overview**

## Architecture Patterns

| Category | Pattern | Reference | Description |
|----------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **Kubernetes** | **DaemonSet / Gateway / Sidecar** | [setup-kubernetes.md](references/setup-kubernetes.md) | Choose based on workload type and data volume (EKS/GKE/AKS/OpenShift/Autopilot/Fargate) |
| **AWS ECS** | **EC2 Daemon / Fargate Sidecar** | [setup-ecs.md](references/setup-ecs.md) | EC2 daemon service with host IP networking; Fargate sidecar with container networking |
| **Docker** | **Standalone / Compose** | [setup-docker.md](references/setup-docker.md) | Docker container with volumes and restart policies; Docker Compose with service discovery |
| **Standalone VM** | **Linux / Windows / macOS** | [setup-vm.md](references/setup-vm.md) | systemd service (Linux), Windows Service, LaunchAgent (macOS), Terraform IaC |
| **Sampling** | **Head / Tail Sampling** | [sampling.md](references/sampling.md) | Trade-off between cost and completeness |
| **Security** | **mTLS + RBAC** | [security.md](references/security.md) | Secure cross-network telemetry pipelines with platform-specific configuration |
| **AI Agents** | **Agent Telemetry** | [ai-agents.md](references/ai-agents.md) | Monitor coding agents as first-class services in your observability stack |

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Gateway Deployment for Tail Sampling

**User**: "I need to deploy an OpenTelemetry gateway in Kubernetes for tail sampling."

**AI Response** (leveraging the skill):
- ✅ Asks about throughput to size replicas
- ✅ Loads `references/architecture.md` and `references/sampling.md`
- ✅ Generates Deployment with load_balancing exporter (routing_key: traceID)
- ✅ Includes Headless Service for sticky sessions
- ✅ Configures tail_sampling processor with error/latency policies
- ✅ Warns about Beta stability level
- ✅ Provides validation commands

### Example 2: Preventing Data Loss

**User**: "Ensure we don't lose telemetry data if the backend goes down."

**AI Response**:
- ✅ Loads `references/collector.md`
- ✅ Configures file_storage extension
- ✅ Attaches persistent queues to exporters
- ✅ Explains disk space requirements
- ✅ Provides PersistentVolume YAML for Kubernetes

### Example 3: Cardinality Guard

**User**: "Add user_id as a metric dimension."

**AI Response**:
- ❌ **Blocks the request**: "user_id violates the Rule of 100—it's unbounded and will cause metric explosion."
- ✅ Suggests alternative: "Use user_id as a trace attribute instead, and create a metric for aggregated user counts."
- ✅ Loads `references/instrumentation.md` to explain cardinality management

### Example 4: Reviewing Existing Helm Values

**User**: "Review this collector Helm values file and tell me what's risky."

**AI Response**:
- ✅ Audits cross-field contradictions, not just YAML syntax
- ✅ Compares `memory_limiter` settings to container memory limits
- ✅ Flags scaled `tail_sampling` without sticky routing
- ✅ Questions `hostPort` on gateway Deployments
- ✅ Calls out retry/queue durability gaps, unsafe RWX/EFS-backed `file_storage`, and rollout-setting conflicts
- ✅ Audits metrics temporality conversions such as `deltatocumulative` when restart or scaling behavior would make the state unsafe
- ✅ Corrects OTTL type mismatches and stale semantic convention keys

See [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) for the full list of progressive disclosure triggers, System 2 thinking signals, core principles, and production-ready configuration defaults.

**Best Practice**: Always pin to released tags matching your collector version (e.g., `v0.100.0+`) instead of using `main` branch for production stability.

## Testing & Validation

This skill includes a comprehensive test and validation framework following TDD (Test-Driven Development) principles:

- **Structured Tessl evals** live in [`evals/`](evals/README.md) and are the canonical published scenarios
- **[tests/baseline-scenarios.md](tests/baseline-scenarios.md)**: RED phase support document for baseline behavior capture
- **[tests/compliance-verification.md](tests/compliance-verification.md)**: GREEN phase support document for verifying behavior changes
- **[tests/rationalization-table.md](tests/rationalization-table.md)**: REFACTOR phase log of agent rationalizations and counters

The testing framework validates that the skill actually changes AI behavior and doesn't allow common anti-patterns. GitHub Actions automatically validates skill structure and content on every change, and the Tessl report workflow posts best-practice review feedback on every pull request.

An additional GitHub Agentic Workflow (`.github/workflows/otel-upstream-maintenance.yml`) runs weekly to create an upstream maintenance digest issue with recent OpenTelemetry GitHub issues, releases, and blog/community updates for practical repository refreshes.

## Contributing

This skill is designed to evolve with the OpenTelemetry ecosystem. Contributions are welcome:

1. **Update Reference Docs**: As OTel features stabilize, update stability warnings
2. **Add Patterns**: New deployment architectures (e.g., eBPF-based collection)
3. **Expand Examples**: Language-specific SDK patterns
4. **Improve Triggers**: Refine the progressive disclosure logic

## Known Limitations

- **AI agent trace coverage varies**: Claude Code does not emit traces natively; observability relies on [opentelemetry-hooks](https://github.com/o11y-dev/opentelemetry-hooks) or native logs/metrics. Each agent has different signal coverage.
- **Tail sampling memory**: Scales with in-flight trace count. Beyond 10k RPS, consider tiered architecture (Agent -> Gateway -> Analysis) rather than single-collector tail sampling.
- **OTTL regex transforms**: Can impact p99 latency at high span volume. Profile with production traffic before deploying regex-heavy transformations.
- **Semantic conventions are evolving**: The `gen_ai.*` namespace is experimental. Attribute names may change in future OpenTelemetry releases.
- **Kubernetes version requirements**: Native sidecar container support requires v1.24+. Earlier versions need traditional sidecar patterns.

## Roadmap

- Expand AI agent observability coverage as new agents ship native telemetry (Qwen Code, Windsurf, Zed)
- Track OpenTelemetry semantic convention releases for `gen_ai` namespace stabilization
- Add cost optimization patterns for high-volume agent deployments
- Expand production playbook coverage with new upstream blog posts
- Add eBPF-based collection patterns for auto-instrumentation
- Collector processor stability matrix tracking across releases

## Compatibility

Compatibility details move faster than the cognitive-router guidance in `SKILL.md`. See [`references/compatibility.md`](references/compatibility.md) for the current version floors and AI agent support notes.
