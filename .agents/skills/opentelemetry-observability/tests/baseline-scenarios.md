# Baseline Scenarios (RED Phase)

> **Purpose:** Test skill effectiveness by comparing agent behavior WITHOUT vs WITH skill loaded
>
> **Iron Law:** Per writing-skills standards, NO SKILL WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST

This document defines test scenarios to validate that opentelemetry-skill actually changes Claude's behavior. Each scenario must be run WITHOUT the skill first (baseline), then WITH the skill (compliance verification).

## Testing Methodology

### RED Phase (This Document)
1. Run each scenario WITHOUT opentelemetry-skill loaded
2. Document verbatim agent responses
3. Identify specific rationalizations and missed opportunities
4. Note which pressures trigger violations

### GREEN Phase (compliance-verification.md)
1. Run same scenarios WITH opentelemetry-skill loaded
2. Document behavior changes
3. Verify agents now comply with patterns

### REFACTOR Phase (rationalization-table.md)
1. Identify new rationalizations from testing
2. Add explicit counters to SKILL.md
3. Re-test until bulletproof

## Scenario 11: Existing Helm Values Audit

**Objective:** Verify agent audits an existing collector values file for cross-field contradictions instead of only fixing syntax.

### Test Prompt
```yaml
Review this OpenTelemetry Collector Helm values snippet and tell me what's risky or inconsistent:

mode: deployment
replicaCount: 1
autoscaling:
  enabled: true
  minReplicas: 4
processors:
  tail_sampling:
    decision_wait: 5s
    num_traces: 1000
  memory_limiter:
    limit_mib: 1500
resources:
  limits:
    memory: 666Mi
ports:
  otlp:
    hostPort: 4317
podDisruptionBudget:
  enabled: true
  minAvailable: 2
exporters:
  otlp:
    retry_on_failure:
      enabled: false
```

### Expected Baseline Behavior (WITHOUT skill)
- May point out one or two obvious issues
- **Likely SKIPS:** cross-field review of memory sizing, sticky routing, `hostPort`, and rollout consistency
- **Likely RATIONALIZES:** "The YAML looks mostly fine; just tune some values"

### Target Behavior (WITH skill)
- Flags that `memory_limiter.limit_mib` exceeds pod memory limit and should leave runtime headroom
- Flags `tail_sampling` on a Deployment that can scale above one replica without sticky routing/load_balancing exporter
- Flags `hostPort` as suspicious for a scaled gateway Deployment
- Flags `retry_on_failure: false` with no durable queue as an explicit data-loss trade-off
- Flags rollout inconsistency across `replicaCount`, HPA, and PodDisruptionBudget
- References collector.md and architecture.md audit guidance

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Agent compares memory limiter settings to pod memory limits
- [ ] Agent identifies sticky-routing requirement for tail sampling
- [ ] Agent questions or rejects `hostPort` on this gateway deployment
- [ ] Agent identifies durability risk from disabled retry / missing queue
- [ ] Agent reviews rollout settings as a combined system, not independent fields

## Scenario 12: Existing Metrics Helm Values Audit

**Objective:** Verify agent audits metrics-specific state, storage, and processor-ordering risks in an existing collector values file.

### Test Prompt
```yaml
Review this OpenTelemetry Collector metrics Helm values snippet and tell me what's risky or inconsistent:

mode: statefulset
autoscaling:
  enabled: true
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 6
processors:
  groupbyattrs/keep_stable_labels:
    keys: [cloud.region, faas.name, k8s.deployment.name]
  deltatocumulative:
    max_stale: 1m
  filter/drop_http:
    error_mode: ignore
    metrics:
      datapoint:
        - 'attributes["http.route"] == ""'
  memory_limiter:
    limit_mib: 1500
resources:
  limits:
    memory: 666Mi
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      processors: [deltatocumulative, filter/drop_http, memory_limiter, batch]
extensions:
  file_storage/queue:
    directory: /var/lib/storage/queue
exporters:
  otlp:
    sending_queue:
      enabled: true
      storage: file_storage/queue
statefulset:
  volumeClaimTemplates:
    - metadata:
        name: queue
      spec:
        storageClassName: efs
        accessModes: [ReadWriteMany]
ports:
  otlp:
    hostPort: 4317
podDisruptionBudget:
  enabled: true
  minAvailable: 1
```

### Expected Baseline Behavior (WITHOUT skill)
- May praise the presence of a persistent queue
- **Likely SKIPS:** that `deltatocumulative` is stateful, that EFS/RWX is unsafe for `file_storage`, that `memory_limiter` is not first, and that `groupbyattrs` is declared but unused
- **Likely RATIONALIZES:** "It already has a queue, so it's mostly production-ready"

### Target Behavior (WITH skill)
- Flags that `memory_limiter.limit_mib` exceeds the pod memory limit and is placed too late in the metrics processor chain
- Flags `deltatocumulative` as a stateful temporality conversion that needs source/backend justification and careful restart/scale assumptions
- Flags `file_storage` on `efs` + `ReadWriteMany` as unsafe for bbolt-backed persistent queues
- Flags `groupbyattrs/keep_stable_labels` as dead config because it is declared but unused
- Questions `hostPort` on a horizontally scalable metrics gateway
- Notes that `podDisruptionBudget.minAvailable: 1` with a single guaranteed replica prevents voluntary eviction unless that trade-off is intentional
- References collector.md audit guidance and persistent-queue filesystem guidance

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Agent compares memory limiter settings to pod memory limits
- [ ] Agent flags `memory_limiter` ordering in the metrics pipeline
- [ ] Agent identifies temporality conversion as stateful and questions whether it is needed
- [ ] Agent identifies EFS/RWX as unsafe for `file_storage`
- [ ] Agent flags declared-but-unused `groupbyattrs`
- [ ] Agent questions `hostPort` or PDB settings in the scaled/single-replica design

## Running These Tests

### Step 1: Prepare Test Environment

**Option A: Separate Claude Session**
- Open Claude in a browser (without skill access)
- Or use different CLI profile without opentelemetry-skill

**Option B: Temporarily Disable Skill**
```bash
mv ~/.claude/skills/opentelemetry-skill ~/.claude/skills/opentelemetry-skill.disabled
```

### Step 2: Run Baseline (WITHOUT Skill)

For each scenario:
1. Copy test prompt exactly
2. Run in Claude WITHOUT skill loaded
3. Document agent response verbatim in `baseline-results/scenario-N.md`
4. Note specific rationalizations used
5. Identify what was missed vs target behavior

### Step 3: Enable Skill

```bash
mv ~/.claude/skills/opentelemetry-skill.disabled ~/.claude/skills/opentelemetry-skill
# Or reload skill in environment
```

### Step 4: Run Compliance Tests (WITH Skill)

See `compliance-verification.md` for detailed methodology.

### Step 5: Document Rationalizations

Capture all excuses/rationalizations in `rationalization-table.md`:
- "Here's a basic configuration"
- "This gives you detailed metrics"
- "Use tail sampling for best results"
- "DaemonSet is the standard pattern"

Each rationalization gets an explicit counter added to SKILL.md.

2. **Accepting high-cardinality metric dimensions** (Scenario 2)
3. **Tail sampling without load balancing** (Scenario 3)
4. **Missing TLS configuration** (Scenario 4)
5. **No PII redaction** (Scenario 5)
6. **No cost analysis for sampling** (Scenario 6)
7. **Generic deployment recommendation** (Scenario 7)
8. **Custom attribute names instead of semantic conventions** (Scenario 8)
9. **Missing persistent queues** (Scenario 9)
10. **Inefficient OTTL transformations** (Scenario 10)
11. **No audit of cross-field config contradictions** (Scenario 11)
12. **No audit of metrics temporality/storage contradictions** (Scenario 12)

### RED Phase Complete When:

- [ ] All 12 scenarios run WITHOUT skill
- [ ] Results documented in `baseline-results/` directory
- [ ] Rationalizations captured verbatim
- [ ] Comparison criteria defined for GREEN phase

---

## Next Steps

After completing RED phase:
1. → `compliance-verification.md` - Run WITH skill, compare results
2. → `rationalization-table.md` - Document excuses, add counters to SKILL.md
3. → Iterate: Find new loopholes, plug them, re-test

**Remember:** This is TDD for documentation. Same rigor as code testing.
